# Rust learning with AoC

This is repo where I document all my victories and pain while I learn Rust. I find this programming language particularly interesting and it might be of help in the future for high-performant data processing applications.

As a data scientist, the way to go from here (once I'm done with AoC 2023) is:

1. Learn Pyo3 (Library for using Rust in Python and Viceversa)
2. Learn Polars
3. Support Open Source Initiatives

Also:

1. Backend programming
2. Systems-level projects
